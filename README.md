# GatoRobotoRandomizer
This is a readme for the GatoRobotoRandomizer. Maybe I'll put something here more useful some day, but until then:

Unzip the latest release from the releases tab, and place the exe file in the same directory as the Gato Roboto exe. Run the rando program, backup your map data, and have some fun!
